Sample website making use of CSS and bootstrap 4

I built this website while learning bootstrap. Before I was not making responsive designs so I made this to learn some new things and also try some things out. Of course the design could be improved a lot if it was an actual website but that was not the purpose of this project.

What I would improve if it was an actual site is the design of the menus, a better footer and better navigation css wise. Of course images and logos would also be improved.
